            <h1 class="title">Being Judgemental</h1>
            <p> We often think that being <i class="its">judgemental</i> is a symbol of arrogance but that's not true everytime , sometimes it have its own benefits.</p>
            <br>
            <p>In 1996 ,David Wolpert gave NFL (No Free Lunch) Theorem for optimizations which stated
                <br>
            <p class="quote">"That if you make no <i class="its">assumptions</i> about data , then there is no way to identify which  machine learing model works better than others."</p>
         </p>
         <p>For some datsets model A would perform better while for some datasets it won't , given that we make some assumptions about the data.</p>
            <p>
                In real world it's not possible to train all machine learning model and evaluate them . so , we make some rational assumptions about the data to narrow down the choice of models which will perform better on that specific dataset.
            </p>

            <p>
                Well well well , there is no such use of this theorem in real life , in almost all cases . The author himself rejected the use of this theorem : )
