We often think that being judgemental is a symbol of arrogance but that's not true everytime , sometimes it have its own benefits.


In 1996 ,David Wolpert gave NFL (No Free Lunch) Theorem for optimizations which stated

"That if you make no assumptions about data , then there is no way to identify which machine learing model works better than others."

For some datsets model A would perform better while for some datasets it won't , given that we make some assumptions about the data.

In real world it's not possible to train all machine learning model and evaluate them . so , we make some rational assumptions about the data to narrow down the choice of models which will perform better on that specific dataset.




Well well well , there is no such use of this theorem in real life , in almost all cases . The author himself rejected the use of this theorem :) 

```jsx
console.log("NFL");
```
